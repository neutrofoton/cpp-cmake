Macro is like a function. 
Although macro look like function, it works in different fashion (mode, cara).

Macro does not introduce new scope (local scope). 
The commands executed inside macro are executed in the parent scope. 
Macro much more like "define" in C/C++ which is just a string replacement.

Macro is case insensitive.
